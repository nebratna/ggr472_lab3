NDVI, which stands for normalized difference vegetation index, is a remote sensing index indicating the level of greenness. The higher the value the greater the level of greenness. The full range of NDVI values is from negative 1 to positive 1. The range of values in this dataset is between 0.1 to 0.62. I used growing season mean of means 250m, which is mean of growing season mean NDVI within 250m. Growing season is defined as May 1st through August 31st.
